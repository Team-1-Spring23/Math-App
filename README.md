# Math-App
Rules before Merging the code, we always troubleshoot the code before making it part of our main.
1. Only merge one code at a time from a person. Not going to merge everyone's code all at once to avoid conflict coding overlapping.
2. After merging the code, troubleshoot as soon as possible. Test all the features you have added, amongst other features within.
3. ALways Name the troubleshooting version by number. An example is ver 0.31 -> 0.32
4. After all codes from all five coders are put together, then the official code will be renamed. An example is 0.35 -> 0.4
5. After troubleshooting and fixing all bugs, I will make it part of our Main breach. The Main breach will always be the verison that I will be present to our class and Doctor A.
