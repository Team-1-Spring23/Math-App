# Math-App
Rules of before Meargeing the code that we always troubleshoot the code before making it part of our main.
1. Only merge one code at a time from a person, not going merge everyone code all at once to avoid conflict coding overlaping.
2. After merge the code, troubleshoot as soon as possible. Test run all the features you have add, amongs other feature within too.
3. ALways Name the trouble shoot version by number. Example being ver 0.31 -> 0.32
4. After all codes from all 5 coders are put together than the offical code will be rename. Example being 0.35 -> 0.4
5. After trouble shooting and fixing up all bugs than I will make it part our Main breach.
